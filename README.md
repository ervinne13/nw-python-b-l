# NuWorks Basic Python on Jupyter B&L

The nice thing about python is that there's very little overhead when learning it. In fact, if we use Jupyter, unlike other workshops/tutorials in this site, there's only one thing you need to get started, and you don't even have to install it. We'll discuss further in the details of this B&L session.

## What You'll Need For This Workshop

Just a Laptop (or even a tablet with a comfortable keyboard) connected to the internet.

## Checklist

- Visit the Jupyter trial website by [clicking here](https://jupyter.org/try) or using the link: [https://jupyter.org/try](https://jupyter.org/try).
- Scroll down a bit and click on "Try Classic Notebook"
- It should open up a new Jupyter notebook that should look like below:

- Check the "Kernel" at the top right of your page. It should say "Python 3" with a Python Logo at the top:

## Learning Objectives

This breakfast & learn session is a mere introductory class. Actually putting what we've learned so far will still be up to the learners.

This session will concentrate more on the programming part of python and will just make use of Jupyter to make it convinient for us to develop.

Early coding best practices will be emphasized.

- Intro: What developers do in NuWorks & Some Opportunities for Non Devs to do Tech Jobs.
