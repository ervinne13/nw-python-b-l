# NuWorks Basic Python on Jupyter B&L

The nice thing about python is that there's very little overhead when learning it. In fact, if we use Jupyter, unlike other workshops/tutorials in this site, there's only one thing you need to get started, and you don't even have to install it. We'll discuss further in the details of this B&L session.

## What You'll Need For This Workshop

Just a Laptop (or even a tablet with a comfortable keyboard) connected to the internet.
