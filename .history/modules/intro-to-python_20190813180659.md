# Introduction to Python Programming

Python development mostly requires no overhead from beginner developers.

Consider the code below written in Java:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}
```

The only code we're really interested in here is ``System.out`` ... and even that in itself is slightly cryptic. What does System, out, and println stand for? why are they required? All of this code is important for seasoned developers but for newbies who have no knowledge of object oriented programming or the `System` namespace would likely have a hard time understanding what each and every code is used for.
