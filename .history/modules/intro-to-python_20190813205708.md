# Introduction to Python Programming

Python development mostly requires no overhead from beginner developers.

Consider the code below written in Java:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}
```

The only code we're really interested in here is ``System.out`` ... and even that in itself is slightly cryptic. What does System, out, and println stand for? why are they required? All of this code is important for seasoned developers but for newbies who have no knowledge of object oriented programming or the `System` namespace would likely have a hard time understanding what each and every code is used for.

## Your first Python Code

Let's now compare that to a python code. First, let's create a fresh file in our notebook. In your Jupyter notebook, click on `File`, `New Notebook` then click `Python 3`:

Then in one cell, write the code:

```
print("Hello, World")
```

Click "Run" and it should print out the string your specified.

__Congratulations!__ You just became a programmer!

## Variables

Variables are keywords you define, they are used to represent a certain value that can be changed on run time.

Writing a variable should look something like:

```python
name = "Ervinne Sodusta"
```

Where `name` is the name of the variable and the words to the right of the `=` sign is called a value, specifically, a "String" value.

You can use any letter, the special characters "_" and every number provided
you do not start with it. 

We may then use a variable in a `print` function:

```python
name = "Ervinne Sodusta"
print(name)
```

This is not very interesting though as the variable here is "constant". Thus, does not provide any real value to us. To make variables actually "variable", let's make use of the `input` function to ask the user of our notebook for an input:

```python
name = input("What's your name boy?")
print(name)
```

This will then printout the string you specified with a text box beside it where you may input any string. The value you specified will then be "assigned" to the `name` variable which we can then use in other statements.

### Concatenating Strings

You may use the `+` operator to "add" or more specifically, concatenate strings:

```python
firstName = input("First Name: ")
lastName = input("Last Name: ")

print(firstName + " " + lastName)
```

### Data Types

A data type is the way a variable is stored and utilized within the computer. So far, we've explored strings in Python, below are other data types:

- `Integer` types are whole numbers: `age = 23` 
- `Float` types are decimals: `weight = 60.4`
- `String` is what we already been dealing with: `name = "Ervinne"`
- `Boolean` types represent `true` or `false`: `isDoneProcessing = true`

## Simple Arithmetic

You may do simple arithmetic with values and variables in coding. For example:

```python
x = input("x: ")
print(x + 5)
```

But this will generate an error pointing to `print(x + 5)` saying that the integer `5` must be a string. The problem isn't really on this line because we really intend to add two integers, the real problem, is that the value of the variable `x` is a string, not an integer. So we modify our code to:

```python
x = int(input("x: "))
print(x + 5)
```

We just told python to get a value, convert it from string to integer before assigning it to the variable `x` so we may do proper arithmetic to it.

The `int` function is used to convert the value provided by `input` from string to an integer. This is called "casting". Casting is when you convert a variable value from one type to another. This is, in Python, done with functions such as `int()` or `float()` or `str()`.

Common arithmetic operations are:

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Exponents: `**` ex: 洧논<sup>2</sup> is `x ** 2`

You may have noticed that we're using familiar terminologies like functions and variables in mathematics. That's because that's exactly what functions and variables in math means.

For example, the function of x:

洧녭(洧논)=2洧논<sup>2</sup>+4洧논+6 

Can be written in Python as:

```python
x = int(input("Evaluate f(x) with x equals: "))
fx = 2 * x ** 2 + 4 * x + 6
print(fx)
```

## Functions

You might be wondering what `input` and `print` and `int` are. These keywords are called `functions` a function is a keyword in python that when "called" or "invoked" does a certain operation.

For example, the `input` function takes in an string `argument` which it displays when asking for an input, then takes our input and `returns` an output.

```python
int(x)
```

An `argument` is anything that we pass in to a function as an input enclosed with open and closed parenthesis. In this case, the `x` variable.

## Creating Your Own Functions

Functions are just operations that are also created by other developers in advanced so we can use later on, like `print` and `input`. With that in mind, we can also create our own functions ourselves.

To define a function, we will use the `def` keyword and the following syntax:

```python
def convert_celsius_to_farenheit(temp):
    return 9/5 * temp + 32
```

You may then invoke this function by:

```python
farenheit = convert_celsius_to_farenheit(20)
print(farenheit)
```

You may also want more than one parameters to a function, like say when you want to get the area of a triangle

```python
def get_triangle_area(base, height):
    return 1/2 * base * height
```

## Lambda Functions

Lambda functions are function without a name, they are also called anonymous functions.

While normal functions are defined using the def keyword, in Python anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword.

These kinds of function are usually passed in as arguments but may also be assigned as a value of a variable. That variable, may then behave as a function. For example, lets convert convert_celsius_to_farenheit to a lambda function:

```python
convert_celsius_to_farenheit = lambda temp: 9/5 * temp + 32
```

Multiple parameter lambda functions will need to have its parameters separated by commas

```python
get_triangle_area = lambda base, height: 1/2 * base * height
```

It may not make sense right now why lambda functions exists, but later on, we will make proper use of them to really reap their benefits. For now, keep their syntax in mind.
