# Introduction to Python Programming

Python development mostly requires no overhead from beginner developers.

Consider the code below written in Java:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}
```

The only code we're really interested in here is ``System.out`` ... and even that in itself is slightly cryptic. What does System, out, and println stand for? why are they required? All of this code is important for seasoned developers but for newbies who have no knowledge of object oriented programming or the `System` namespace would likely have a hard time understanding what each and every code is used for.

## Your first Python Code

Let's now compare that to a python code. First, let's create a fresh file in our notebook. In your Jupyter notebook, click on `File`, `New Notebook` then click `Python 3`:

Then in one cell, write the code:

```
print("Hello, World")
```

Click "Run" and it should print out the string your specified.

__Congratulations!__ You just became a programmer!

## Variables

Variables are keywords you define, they are used to represent a certain value that can be changed on run time.

Writing a variable should look something like:

```python
name = "Ervinne Sodusta"
```

Where `name` is the name of the variable and the words to the right of the `=` sign is called a value, specifically, a "String" value.

You can use any letter, the special characters "_" and every number provided
you do not start with it. 

We may then use a variable in a `print` function:

```python
name = "Ervinne Sodusta"
print(name)
```

This is not very interesting though as the variable here is "constant". Thus, does not provide any real value to us. To make variables actually "variable", let's make use of the `input` function to ask the user of our notebook for an input:

```python
name = input("What's your name boy?")
print(name)
```

This will then printout the string you specified with a text box beside it where you may input any string. The value you specified will then be "assigned" to the `name` variable which we can then use in other statements.

### Data Types

A data type is the way a variable is stored and utilized within the computer. So far, we've explored strings in Python, below are other data types:

- `Integer` types are whole numbers: `age = 23` 
- `Float` types are decimals: `weight = 60.4`
- `String` is what we already been dealing with: `name = "Ervinne"`
- `Boolean` types represent `true` or `false`: `isDoneProcessing = true`



## Simple Arithmetic

You may do simple arithmetic with values and variables in coding. For example:
-
```python
x = int(input("x: "))
print(x + 5)
```

We just told python to get a value, convert it from string to 

The `int` function is used to convert the value provided by `input` from string to an integer.

You may have noticed that we're using familiar terminologies like functions and variables in mathematics. That's because that's exactly what functions and variables in math means.

For example, the function of x:

ùëì(ùë•)=2ùë•<sup>2</sup>+4ùë•+6 

Can be written in Python as:

```python
x = int(input("Evaluate f(x) with x equals: "))
fx = 2 * x ** 2 + 4 * x + 6
print(fx)
```

The operation `*` means to multiply while `**` means to raise something to a power.
